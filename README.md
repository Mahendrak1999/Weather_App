# Weather App - ITMD 555 Project

## Welcome

This Weather App is a collaborative project developed by Ankita Bhutkar (A20513345) and Mahendra Koravi (A20513294) as part of the ITMD 555 course.

## Project Overview

Our Weather App originated from the task of temperature conversion and evolved into a comprehensive application. We aimed to address the issue of information overload present in many weather apps by adopting a minimalist approach. The goal was to create a user-friendly interface focusing on essential functionalities, offering clear and precise weather information.

## App Features

- Display Time, Appropriate Weather Image, Temperature & Rain Prediction
- Hourly Weather Info
- Feels Like Temperature
- Overall Rain/Snow Forecast
- Current Temperature (C & F)
- Choose Desired Location
- Convert F to C or Vice Versa
- Assess Next 15 Days Weather Forecast
- Task Bar: Display UV Index, Humidity & Visibility of the day
- Other Weather Info: Showing selected day, date, current time, and year.
- Selected Day: Displaying Sunrise and Sunset timings of the chosen day.

### Technical Challenges
